# Equation_solvers
PDE solvers based on the FFT solver framework of DAMASK

1. The solver framework being created for equation of type:

\tau \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot \left( 2 h(\eta) \nabla \theta \right)

This is the first part of the equation 40 mentioned in https://doi.org/10.1080/14786435.2012.713135
